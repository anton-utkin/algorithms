Algorithms Library

   This project is intended to show solutions for different algorithmic 
problems. All source code is covered by unit tests with usage of JUnit 
framework to minimize probability of bugs. 
Project is developed as open-source library and consists of solutions 
for frequent algorithmic problems. Such approach allows reusing ready 
solutions in different projects in case of need.


Current list of solved problems:
+ Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) 
+ Merge Sort
+ Breadth First Search in Graph
+ Depth First Search in Graph
+ Min Heap data structure
